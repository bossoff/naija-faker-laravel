# Laravel NaijaFaker

## Introduction ðŸ‘‹

This is a simple package that generates fake typical Nigerian data ranging from `name`, `address`, `phone number`, `lgas` and `states`. This can be used mostly for generating fake data for your application.

> NB: Nigeria as a country has some many languages. `Yoruba`, `Igbo` and `Hausa` are the only languages supported at the moment.

```bash
composer require kodegrenade/naija-faker-laravel

  |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |
  | The service providers listed here will be automatically loaded on the
  | request to your application. Feel free to add your own services to
