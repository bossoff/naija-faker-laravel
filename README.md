# Laravel NaijaFaker â–²

## Introduction ðŸ––

This is a simple package that generates fake typical Nigerian data ranging from `name`, `address`, `phone number`, `lgas` and `states`. This can be used mostly for generating fake data for your application.

## Installation

Install via composer

```bash
composer require kodegrenade/naija-faker-laravel
```

Add service provider to the `config/app.php` file

```php
<?php
  /*
  |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | Autoloaded Service Providers
  |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  |
  | The service providers listed here will be automatically loaded on the
  | request to your application. Feel free to add your own services to
  | this array to grant expanded functionality to your applications.
